# Battery Health Management System (BHMS)

This project presents an ESP32-based Battery Health Management System designed to monitor lithium-ion battery voltage and temperature in real time. The system introduces a Temperature Abuse Counter that logs unsafe thermal events to evaluate long-term battery health without adding hardware complexity.

## Key Features
- Real-time battery voltage monitoring
- Continuous temperature monitoring using DS18B20
- Temperature Abuse Counter for thermal stress tracking
- Non-volatile storage of abuse events
- Low-cost and scalable embedded design

## Project Status
 
Hardware implementation is in progress.

## Applications
- Electric vehicles
- Portable electronics
- Battery-powered embedded systems
- Energy storage monitoring
